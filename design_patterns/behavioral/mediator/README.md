# Mediator Design Pattern
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

So is useful when we have got couple of objects which have to talk each other.

Example: Pilots of aircraft that approach or depart the airport control area donâ€™t communicate directly with each other. Instead, they speak to an air traffic controller, who sits in a tall tower somewhere near the airstrip. Without the air traffic controller, pilots would need to be aware of every plane in the vicinity of the airport, discussing landing priorities with a committee of dozens of other pilots. That would probably skyrocket the airplane crash statistics.

## Help
1. Reduce communications between objects.
2. Reduce complexity.
3. Codes will be more readable, extensible and maintainable.

## Pros
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the communications between various components into a single place, making it easier to comprehend and maintain.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new mediators without having to change the actual components.
- You can reduce coupling between various components of a program.
- You can reuse individual components more easily.

## Cons
- Over time a mediator can evolve into a God Object.

## Example
- Django Form, DRF Serializer
