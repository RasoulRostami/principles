# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Composite
lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Adapter
allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## Facade 
provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Decorator
lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## Flyweight
lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

## Bridge
lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies

## Proxy
lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
