# Decorator Pattern
We use this pattern to add additional behavior to an object without change the main object

## Pros
- You can extend an object’s behavior without making a new subclass.
- You can add or remove responsibilities from an object at runtime.
- You can combine several behaviors by wrapping an object into multiple decorators.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can divide a monolithic class that implements many possible variants of behavior into several smaller classes.

## Cons
- It’s hard to remove a specific wrapper from the wrappers stack.
- It’s hard to implement a decorator in such a way that its behavior doesn’t depend on the order in the decorators stack.
- The initial configuration code of layers might look pretty ugly.

## example
- DRF @action
- Django @permission
