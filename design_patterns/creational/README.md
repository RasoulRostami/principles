# Creational Design Pattern
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Prototype
Let you create new object by copying an existing object

## Singleton
lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Factory Method
provides an interface for creating objects in a super-class, but allows sub-classes to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of related objects.

## Builder
lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
