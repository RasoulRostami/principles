# Prototype Pattern
prototype pattern let you create a new objects by copying an existing objects.
For example in power-point or draw.io you can duplicate objects, create new one by copying old objects.

## Pros
- Have Open/Close codes.
- Avoid developer mistake. 
- Produce complex objects more conveniently.
- Clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.

## Cons
- Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.

## Example
- Draw.io
