# Factory Method Pattern
Factory Method provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
- Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.

## Pros
- You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

## Cons
- The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when youâ€™re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
